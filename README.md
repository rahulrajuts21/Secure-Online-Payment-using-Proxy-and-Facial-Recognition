# Secure-Online-Payment-using-Proxy-and-Facial-Recognition
To overcome the limitations and security holes we have proposed a 2-step authentication in transaction process. Advantage of our proposed system is Proxy Detection will be implemented using image processing technique. This provided more secure to the system. In the proposed system, Face Verification will be implemented using Face Net Deep Learning Algorithm to embed with 128 feature points of the face. We use One-shot learning to quickly learn the faces of the user. Also using OpenCV bounding box focus is created around the face so other people in the background are not focused. Embed 128 features point of each person face will be calculated with triplet loss function. Also different approaches like Resents are experimented.
